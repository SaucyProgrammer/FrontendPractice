        <h3>China stops separating families under COVID lockdown amid outcry</h3>

        <br>
        <p>Authorities in China rarely bow to public pressure, but an outcry over COVID-positive kids being separated from their parents in the locked-down megacity of Shanghai appears to have brought an unusual change in policy. An official in Shanghai announced Wednesday that parents would be allowed to remain with their kids in mass-quarantine centers even if the parents themselves were not infected with the coronavirus.</p>
